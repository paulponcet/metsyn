RE-USE OF INFORMATION UNDER THIS LICENCE

The "Producer" grants the "Re-user" a worldwide, perpetual, free of charge,

YOU ARE FREE TO RE-USE THE "INFORMATION":

YOU MUST, WHERE YOU DO ANY OF THE ABOVE:

- Attribute the "Information" by acknowledging its source (at least the name of
the "Producer") and the date on which it was last updated.

The "Re-user" may fulfil this condition by providing one or more hypertext
links (URL) referring to the "Information" and effectively acknowledging its
source.

This attribution shall not suggest any official status or endorsement, by the
"Producer" or any other public entity, of the "Re-user" or the re-use of the
"Information".


LIABILITY

The "Information" is made available as produced or received by the "Producer",
without any other express or tacit guarantee not specified in this licence.

charge, under the freedoms and the conditions defined by this licence. It
cannot guarantee that the "Information" does not contain any error or
irregularity. It does not guarantee the continued supply of the "Information".
It shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage of any kind caused to
third parties resulting from its re-use.

The "Re-user" is solely responsible for its re-use of the "Information". The

"Information", its source and its time of last update.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

The "Producer" guarantees that the "Information" is not subject to any
"Intellectual property rights" belonging to third parties.

"Intellectual property rights" that might be held by the "Producer" over
documents containing the "Information" do not impede the free re-use of the
"Information". Where the "Producer" holds "Intellectual property rights" over
documents which contain the "Information", it assigns them, on a non-exclusive
basis, free of charge, worldwide and for the entire term of the
"Intellectual property rights", to the "Re-user", who may make use thereof in
accordance with the freedoms and conditions defined in this licence.

ABOUT THE OPEN LICENCE

Etalab is the task force under the French Prime Minister's authority leading
Open Government Data policy for France. Etalab introduces the Open Licence to
facilitate and encourage easy reuse of public sector information - as defined
by French Law - free of charge and as broadly as possible,

    Within the scope of their public service missions, public sector bodies
    produce and receive public sector information, which may be re-used by any
    natural or legal person.

    Under the terms of French Law, are not considered public sector
    information: information the communication of which is not a right under
    information access legislation; information contained in documents
    produced or received by public sector bodies exercising a public service of
    industrial or commercial character; and information contained in documents
    over which third parties hold intellectual property rights,

    Information which contains personal data is not considered to be public
    sector information re-usable under the terms of French Law - except where
    persons on which data is collected have agreed to its reuse, where this
    data has been rendered anonymous by the public sector bodies, or where a
    legal or statutory provision permits its re-use (in these three cases,
    re-use is subject to compliance with French privacy protection legislation).

This licence is version 1.0 of the Open Licence. Etalab may, from time to time,
offer new versions of the Open Licence. However, re-users may continue to
re-use information available under this licence if they wish to do so.
